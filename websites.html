                        <p>
                            This website is my first real leap into using React. The site is essentially a recipe page allowing the user to select from a range of different meal and beverage types and through them selecting a specific recipe. A cook book!</br>
                            I'm sure there's a lot of potential imporvements that could be made to the site and the code is probably bulkier than optimal, but making this really helped me get to grips witht he basics of React and that was it's main purpose really.
                            On top of that, I used an API (FireBase) for the first time and interacted with a .json file in order to store the bulk of the pages information which I think will prove very helpful for future projects.</br>
                            The goal of how the site would function was to make it as quick and straight forward as possible for the user to access the information they wanted without compromising too much on it's design by having too much hand-holding. You can decide for 
                            yourself if I achieved this goal or not.</br>As of writing this the page is not yet completed but functionally it's well on it's way. Gathering the data from the API going smoothly and changing from recipe to recipe is done in an instant.
                            Most of the work that's still required is to do with styles, getting images and updating the content of the recipes.</br>Upon reflection, when the next step in your project is documenting how to cook a curry you may have overcomplicated things . . .
