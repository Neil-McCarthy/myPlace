                        <h1>
                            This one!
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            The final image of this site has been ever-changing ever since starting it. As soon as I'd learn something new or understand something better
                            I'd come back here and have to gut it and make so many imporvements that the original code was virtually non-existent, or else I'd have
                            a completely different idea for how a certain piece should look or function and have to scrap the old to make space for the new.</br>It's been 
                            a fantastic sandbox for me as I slowly navigate my way novicehood in programming. I can add little canvas games to it, throw these little personal 
                            monologues where I fawn over my own work, and I can remake this in to whatever I'd like whenever I'd like. It's the perfect site for trying something
                            new.</br>I'm also pretty happy with it's current state. Pretty much every aspect of it is a work in progress and there are so many things to do
                            (I'm currently about half way through making a curry for a recipe site, the first dish of who knows how many) that I have absolutely no idea
                            when I'll be finished, but I really feel like my approach to writing code has really matured. What used to take a whole chunk of code I can now
                            perform in a single line.</br>Since the beginning of this project, my passion for programming hasn't faltered once but instead has only grown even
                            greater, and while there's still an endless amount for me to learn, I'm filled with nothing but excitement about what's to come.

                        <p>
                            This website is my first real leap into using React. The site is essentially a recipe page allowing the user to select from a range of different meal and beverage types and through them selecting a specific recipe. A cook book!</br>
                            I'm sure there's a lot of potential imporvements that could be made to the site and the code is probably bulkier than optimal, but making this really helped me get to grips witht he basics of React and that was it's main purpose really.
                            On top of that, I used an API (FireBase) for the first time and interacted with a .json file in order to store the bulk of the pages information which I think will prove very helpful for future projects.</br>
                            The goal of how the site would function was to make it as quick and straight forward as possible for the user to access the information they wanted without compromising too much on it's design by having too much hand-holding. You can decide for 
                            yourself if I achieved this goal or not.</br>As of writing this the page is not yet completed but functionally it's well on it's way. Gathering the data from the API going smoothly and changing from recipe to recipe is done in an instant.
                            Most of the work that's still required is to do with styles, getting images and updating the content of the recipes.</br>Upon reflection, when the next step in your project is documenting how to cook a curry you may have overcomplicated things . . .
