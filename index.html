                    My name is Neil McCarthy. I've been programming for around 3 years and worked as a front-end developer for a year. I'm looking to get a position as a front-end engineer within a team where I can learn and grow my skills
                    and in time I'd like to progress in to full-stack development.</br>Programming has become one of my greatest passions over the years and is something I can't ever see myself setting aside and I'm very eager
                    to further my career in this field.

                    I received a 1:1 in my post-graduate degree of Applied Computing Technology and a 2:1 in my primary degree witha major in English Literature and a minor in Psychology, both from University College Cork.</br>
                    I studied under some fantastic lecturers here, many of whom instilled in me a great passion for learning that I still carry with me today.

                    The primary languages that I would use would be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each being a language that I have been using regularly for the past 3 years. React is my favoured framework for react and I've been learning it for around 6 months,
                    although I have also used Angular as well. As for back-end languages, I studied Python and mySQL in college and have a firm grasp of their fundementals but C# is a language I've recently started learning and is one I have a keen interested
                    in persuing further.

                    Most recently I worked as an IT Administrator in Jacobs Engineering where I performed the usual tasks of an IT service member but I was also tasked with front-end web development. I've also worked several years as an IT Admin in companies such as PFH and PGI.

                    I'm just a simple little lad from Cork. I've been involved in rowing for the past 15 years where I learned a great deal about work ethic and team work. One of my fondest memories of the sport was competing at
                    Henley Royal Regatta ("The mecca of amateur rowing", as some have described it).</br>I'm a self-proclaimed movie buff and foodie, and there's little else I enjoy more than good conversation, especially
                    with someone with a differing perspective to mine.</br>Big tea drinker.
