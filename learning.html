                    <p>
                        When I was learning JavaScript in college for the first time I remember thinking, when will I ever use this clunky backwards language? Now I can't imagine making anything without it. What was once double Dutch
                        has now become the best means for me to get what I have in my head onto a website. It's an incredibly functional language and, while it's not flawless, it feels near limitless in what it allows you to do.

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        I've been using this language for years now and every few weeks I feel as if I'm close to mastering it, only to find some new extension of JavaScript that I'd never heard of or a new and better way of doing
                        somthing that puts my code to shame. But I think that's fantastic, knowing that there's still so much to do and learn with this language. It's like reading your favourite book and every time you get close to the end
                        another 10 chapters appear out of nowhere.\nI'd be confident enough to say that I'm past the beginning stages of this language. My code is clearer, more concise, and more trimmed down. I'm more able to create whatever
                        I'd like and if I'm not then I've got a good process for working it out. Yet while I'm very proud of where I've gotten with it so far I'm very much looking forward to taking it even further.

                    <p>
                        I've used JavaScritp in all of the websites I've done. A lot of the time it's for making a page seem animated by adding something that responds to the users scrolling, clicks or input, but a lot of i
                        would be working in the background too to make the site easier to use and more accessible to the user. Things like local storage to remember a users input when going from page to page, or adding smoother transitions
                        when changing the content of a page to make the update less jaring.\nI made several 2D games using only JavaScript and while on one side they take up a lot of time and can cause quite a headache, what I was
                        able to learn through making them has prooved invaluable. Managing mutiple objects at once and doing so effectively, dealing with multiple user inputs at once, being able to properly events that were happening between
                        different objects (collisions, respawns, relative direction), plus a whole host of other factors that came into to play when making these. They may not be groundbreaking games but they were fantastic learning tools.\nThe
                        latest thing I've been using within JavaScript is accessing bulk information in a JSON file through an API. To those that are familiar with this I'm sure it seems a bit simple but for me who was storing all of this info
                        in dozens of differnt variables or in enormous objects, this was pretty game changing. I've only just started using this and am only doing so as a library of data but I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do with it
                        in time.`

                    <p>
                        To me, JavaScript is the easiest and best way for me to interact with a website and I have absolutely no intention of stopping or slowing down my using of it. I'm pretty happy with how I use it now but 
                        considering that looking at the quality of sites or projects I did only a few months ago has me close to tears, it's pretty safe to say an evolution is inevitable.\nI don't have any specific goals in mind with this language
                        aside from integrating other languages with it (especially more back-end languages) but there's always a new project with a something I haven't done before just around the corner.
